# Topo

Our solution will use algebraic topology to calculate a quantitative indicator that measures the structural resilience of financial markets by analyzing the correlation network among stocks rather than focusing solely on price variability as the VIX does. Additionally, MSI can act as an early-warning signal that is lacking in the current VIX. 

These features of the MSI allows it to complement existing volatility indices rather than replacing them, providing a structural perspective on risk that helps investors better anticipate shifts and market responses to shocks.
